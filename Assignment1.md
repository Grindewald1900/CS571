## Exercises

### 1.Does there exist a graph with the following specified properties? Justify
### &emsp;(a)A simple graph with 5 vertices and 12 edges.
 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; No, there doesn't exist such a graph. 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Proof:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The complete graph K<sub>5</sub> has the most edges for a graph with 5 vertices.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; e(K<sub>5</sub>) = (5 $\times$ 4)/2 = 10, which is less than 12.
  
### &emsp;(b)A simple graph in which each vertex has degree 3 and which has exactly 6 edges.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp Yes, there does.   

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Proof:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Suppose that G = (V,E) has n vertices, according to The Handshaking Theorem:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2 $\times$ e = 3 $\times$ n   
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In this example, e = 6  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; So, n = 4  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Actually, that is a 4 vertices complete graph.

### &emsp;(c)A simple graph with five vertices with degrees 2, 3, 3, 3, and 2.



2.Does there exist a simple graph G with 28 edges and 12 vertices, each of degree 3 or 4?
3.Does there exist a simple graph G with 28 edges and 12 vertices, each of degree 3 or 6?
4.Prove that a graph that contains a triangle cannot be bipartite.
5.Must a subgraph of a bipartite graph be bipartite? Would your answer change if, in the definition of a bipartite graph, bipartition sets were required to be nonempty?
6.Prove that the number of edges in a bipartite graph with n vertices is
n2
at most é ’
7.How many complete bipartite graphs have n vertices?
& Let V = {1, 2,.n}.
(a)How many simple graphs are there with vertex set V?
(b)How many of these graphs contain the triangle 123?
(c)What is the total number of triangles in all the graphs with vertex set V?
(d)On average, how many triangles does a graph on n labeled vertices contain?
9.What is the largest possible number of vertices in a graph with 35 edges, all vertices having degree at least 3?
10.Suppose all vertices in a graph G have odd degree k. Show that the total number of edges in G is a multiple of k.
11.Can there exist a graph with 13 vertices, 31 edges, 3 vertices of degree 1, and 7 vertices of degree 4? Justify.
